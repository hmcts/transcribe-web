// Reads the duration of an audio File in the browser, before upload, by
// loading just its metadata into a detached <audio> element. Runs client-side
// because the backend only learns the real duration once Azure has finished
// transcribing — too late to show "Transcribing 2h 36m of audio" while the
// job is still processing. Best-effort: resolves to undefined (rather than
// rejecting) if the browser can't decode the file or metadata never loads, so
// a failure here never blocks the upload itself.
//
// For a valid audio file `loadedmetadata` fires almost immediately, so the
// caller can safely await this before uploading. The timeout is deliberately
// short: it only bites for files whose metadata never loads (corrupt or
// unsupported), where we'd rather proceed with the upload promptly and simply
// omit the duration than stall the user waiting on a value we won't get.
